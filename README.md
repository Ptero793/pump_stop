# pump_stop

The goal of this project is to save time and emotional headache for breast-feeding women. 

Nowadays, moms are working more and more, but they understand the benefits of breast-feeding longer and so want to: 

-minimize the number of days they have to keep pumping breast milk

-use what you produce, before it expires. 

-maximize nutrients for your new child!
